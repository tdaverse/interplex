Description: Computational topology, which enables topological data analysis
    (TDA), makes pervasive use of abstract mathematical objects called
    simplicial complexes; see Edelsbrunner and Harer (2010)
    <doi:10.1090/mbk/069>.
    Several R packages and other software libraries used through an R interface
    construct and use data structures that represent simplicial complexes,
    including mathematical graphs viewed as 1-dimensional complexes.
    This package provides coercers (converters) between these data structures.
    Currently supported structures are complete lists of simplices as used by
    'TDA'; the simplex trees of Boissonnat and Maria (2014)
    <doi:10.1007/s00453-014-9887-3> as implemented in 'simplextree' and in
    Python GUDHI (by way of 'reticulate'); and the graph classes of 'igraph' and
    'network', by way of the 'intergraph' package.
